# Hello React Table Library

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@table-library/react-table-library)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@table-library/react-table-library) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/table-library/react-table-library)](https://github.com/table-library/react-table-library/blob/main/LICENSE) [![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/table-library/react-table-library?style=social)](https://github.com/table-library/react-table-library/)

React Table Library -- yet another table library for React -- which prioritzes:

* composition over configuration
* customization
* extensibility
* server-side
* developer experience

## Installation

```
npm install @table-library/react-table-library
```

```
yarn add @table-library/react-table-library
```

## The Problem

You find yourself looking for a fitting table component which solves your problem, but you cannot find the one solution which comes with all the desired features yet stays customisable for a pleasant developer experience. Personally I ran into this problem myself after working with lots of different React table components -- from UI libraries but also as standalone libraries -- and none of them felt right to me. After working on React tables for three different clients of mine over the past year, I decided to roll my own solution for them. I came to the conclusion that the React ecosystem needs another table library -- which does things right.

## The Solution

In 2020, [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de) created React Table Library in collaboration with [Big Ladder Software](https://bigladdersoftware.com/). After working with different table libraries to fit his client's needs, they decided to roll their own solution with the following subjects in mind ...

<Grid container spacing={3}>
  <Grid item xs={6}>
    <Card style={{ height: '100%' }}>
      <CardContent>
        <Typography color="textSecondary" gutterBottom>
          Composition over Configuration
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="p">
          React Table Library is built with <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-composition">composition</a> in mind. Forget about all the table components which need huge configuration objects.

        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="p">
          Whether you are looking for bulk selecting, paginated fetches or a tree table, React Table Library comes with lots of advanced features.

          Highly Customisable
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="p">
          React Table Library attempts to give you freedom on how to compose your table. From providing your own icon to using a button in a table cell, you gain full control about what's getting rendered.

          Server-Side as First-Class Citizen
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="p">
          React Table Library is built with server-side capabilities in mind, because fetching all data at once and doing only client-side operations should not be the status quo for modern applications.
