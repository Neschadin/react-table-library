# Help & Feature Request

This library got produced for a client of mine and hence runs in production for them. All features were tailored to this client, however, the plan is to make the library accessible for anyone. Therefore we decided to open source it. If you and your company have any further feature requests, please contact me and we can negotiate the terms. If you company needs help to implement this library in their application, perhaps with more advanced server-side features, do not hesitate to ask for my help as a freelance developer.
