React Table Library -- yet another table library for React -- which prioritzes:

- composition over configuration
- customization
- extensibility
- server-side
- developer experience

**[Documentation](https://react-table-library.com/)**

## Requirements

React Table Library requires the following be installed:

- React 16.13.1+
- styled-components 4.0.0+ || 5.0.0+

## Installation

```
npm install @table-library/react-table-library
```

```
yarn add @table-library/react-table-library
```

## The Problem

You find yourself looking for a fitting table component which solves your problem, but you cannot find the one solution which comes with all the desired features yet stays customisable for a pleasant developer experience. Personally I ran into this problem myself after working with lots of different React table components -- from UI libraries but also as standalone libraries -- and none of them felt right to me. After working on React tables for three different clients of mine over the past year, I decided to roll my own solution for them. I came to the conclusion that the React ecosystem needs another table library -- which does things right.

## The Solution

In 2020, [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de) created React Table Library in collaboration with [Big Ladder Software](https://bigladdersoftware.com/). After working with different table libraries to fit their needs, they decided to roll their own solution with the following subjects in mind ...

- composition over configuration
- customization
- extensibility
- server-side
- developer experience
